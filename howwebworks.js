1.  HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol and is used to communicate between browsers and web servers.
2. URL is Uniform resource locator. URL is the address to a published resource on the web.
3. The DNS (domain name system) translates domain names into IP addresses so that browsers can load sources. 
   This eliminates the need to remember lengthy IP numbers. It is much easier to remember that way.
4.   A query string is the portion of a URL where data is passed to web applications/back-end.
5.GET -retrieves or reads information from a source as a representation  in the form of XML or JSON. 
 POST- is used to create new resources that are subordinate to a parent resource.

6.An HTTP request is a request made by a client to a named host that is located on a server.

7. An HTTP response is carried out by the server to the client to provide the requested information. 
8. Headers provide additional information about the request or response. 
      Some examples of request headers are accept-language, accept-encoding.
      Some examples of response headers are content-encoding, content-type.
9.   The browser uses DNS to make an IP out of the URL, requests are sent to the IP 
       The server makes a response, the browser makes a DOM out of the response, lastly the browser makes new
        requests for any new information needed from the DOM.
